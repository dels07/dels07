## Hi there, I'm Deli 👋

> I used to be an IT manager some time ago. But I loved the programming world, so in 2017, I decided to work on a tech startup until today.

My real name is Deli. Besides programming, I'm a father with three kids, and I spend my free time with them. What about my job? I love to exchange knowledge and experience with others and find a way to motivate teams. Improving the development process is really important for me. Combining these interests and skills, I feel responsible for writing documentation, proposing conventions, or setting code-quality recommendations and making the way easier for others every time I have the opportunity. 🤗

## My career path

#### ❤ [Mekari](https://mekari.com/) (2021 - Today)

I am currently working at Mekari on the Talenta tribe as a senior software engineer. This workplace has a nice culture where I learned a lot of things about personal and professional growth. Sometimes I also act as a backup team leader, where I also manage middle-level engineers. My first year was mostly spent working on code refactoring, completing documentation, and improving the quality of development with everyone in the teams.

- Working on Talenta mobile apps and website, mostly as backend developer
- Improving development processes for the whole dev team
